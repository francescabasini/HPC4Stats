# SCRTP
The Scientific Computing RTP manages high performance computing (HPC) facilities that are available for you to use.  First you will need an SCRTP account (which differs from, but requires your normal Warwick ITS account).  
Obtain your SCRTP account [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/desktop/gettingstarted).

## Linux Desktop
The SCRTP supports a scientific desktop environment based on GNU/Linux.

ssh username@godzilla.csc.warwick.ac.uk

This is a _shared_ remote desktop resource, there may be dozens of people logged in at any time. It can be used:
* for editing files, compiling code, plotting simple graphs or submitting
computational jobs to the _taskfarm_ only
* You must NOT run significant computations of any kind on godzilla.

## Orac, Avon

These are two supercomputers that you have to register for access for separately (no need to do so now, it can take a while to obtain access).  The main strengths of these machines are as follows ([more information](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/hpc/)):

Orac -> Parallel computing

ssh username@orac.css.warwick.ac.uk


Avon -> Parallel computing and GPU computing

ssh username@avon.scrtp.warwick.ac.uk
