# SCRTP
The SCRTP manages high performance computing (HPC) facilities that are available for you to use.  First you will need an SCRTP account (which differs from, but requires your normal Warwick ITS account).  Obtain your SCRTP account [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/desktop/gettingstarted).

## Orac, Avon

These are two supercomputers that you have to register for access for separately (no need to do so now, it can take a while to obtain access).  The main strengths of these machines are as follows ([more information](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/hpc/)):

Orac -> Parallel computing
ssh username@orac.css.warwick.ac.uk


Avon -> Parallel computing and GPU computing
ssh username@avon.scrtp.warwick.ac.uk
